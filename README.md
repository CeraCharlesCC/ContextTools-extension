# Context Tools

A Chromium / Firefox browser extension that exports GitHub PRs and Issues to Markdown — ready to paste into any LLM.

## Why does this exist?

Modern coding workflows rely heavily on AI agents, but the most capable frontier models — like GPT-5.2 Pro or Gemini 3 Pro Deepthink — are often only accessible through their web UIs, or their API pricing makes casual use prohibitively expensive. When you occasionally need to hand-feed context from a PR or Issue to one of those models, manually copying and formatting everything is tedious.

**Context Tools** solves this by adding a one-click "Copy as Markdown" button directly to GitHub's PR and Issue pages.

> [!TIP]
> Pairs nicely with [Copy4LM](https://github.com/CeraCharlesCC/Copy4LM) — a VSCode / IntelliJ IDEA extension that lets you export entire folders or directory trees as Markdown.
